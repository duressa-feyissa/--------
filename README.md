# Asekign Chaweta

## Overview

Asekign Chaweta is a modified version of the classic game Tetris, infused with elements of the Geez alphabet and an additional gameplay rule. In this game, players manipulate blocks composed of Geez letters rather than traditional Tetris shapes. Additionally, a unique rule requires players to press the space bar or click to change the current block, adding an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay.

## Features

- Geez Letter Blocks: Instead of the traditional Tetris shapes, players manipulate blocks composed of Geez letters, adding a cultural twist to the game.
- Dynamic Block Change: Players can press the space bar or click to change the current block, allowing for strategic planning and adaptation to the game's pace.
- Classic Tetris Gameplay: While Addis Chaweta introduces new elements, it retains the core mechanics of Tetris, requiring players to manipulate falling blocks to complete lines and prevent the screen from filling up.

## How to Play

1. **Controls:**
   - Use the arrow keys to move the falling block left or right.
   - Press the down arrow key to accelerate the block's descent.
   - Press the up arrow key to rotate the block.
   - Press the space bar or click to change the current block.
2. **Objective:**
   - Arrange the falling blocks to form solid lines without any gaps.
   - When a line is completed, it will disappear, and the player will earn points.
   - Prevent the blocks from reaching the top of the screen. If they do, the game ends.
3. **Block Change Rule:**
   - Unlike traditional Tetris, where blocks are predetermined, Addis Chaweta allows players to change the current block by pressing the space bar or clicking. This adds an extra layer of strategy as players can select the most advantageous block for their current situation.
4. **Scoring:**
   - Earn points by completing lines. The more lines completed simultaneously, the higher the score.
   - As the game progresses, the falling speed of the blocks increases, adding to the challenge.
